    \textbf{AI for Good Research Lab}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and developed TorchGeo, a PyTorch domain library providing datasets, models, samplers, and transforms for geospatial data: \url{https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo}
        \item Developed data loaders for computing the intersection/union between arbitrary raster and vector files
        \item Developed geospatial-aware samplers for random access of large heterogenous datasets
        \item Provided first ever model weights pre-trained on satellite imagery in a deep learning library
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Urban Innovation Initiative}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a deep learning pipeline for interpolation, forecasting, and inversion of air quality data
        \item Integrated pipeline with Azure ML Studio and Mapbox for continuous learning and visualization
        \item Worked with data from BEACO\textsubscript{2}N, EPA, PurpleAir, and Eclipse air quality sensor networks
        \item Wrote a white paper on urban air quality sensing and future work that needs to be done in this space
    \end{itemize}
